<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let's move on to yet another level. This time, you'll improve the control panel and finally launch the rocket!</p>

<p>You've already ensured the protection of the control deck. Launching a rocket is a very delicate operation and a lot of things can go wrong, so let's create a second layer of protection: the launch button should be disabled until all the systems are ready. Let's assume that they're ready when all the check-buttons are checked and all the levers are set to the highest. Implement the function that will be called after any sort of change occurs with the check-buttons or levers. It should check the condition and, if all is well, enable the launch button.</p>

<p>All the systems are ready, so it looks like we can finally launch the rocket! Make your rocket take off with the help of JS animation. Implement the function that will change the position of the rocket following the flight trajectory.</p>

<p>At the end of the stage when everything's ready, you can say "3.. 2... 1.. liftoff!", launch the rocket, and feel like a real space engineer!</p>

<p>Here are some additional features that you can implement after completing the project (our tests don't check for them):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Improve the controls so that you can set the speed of the rocket and change the trajectory angle;</li>
	<li>Make the trajectory more complex;</li>
	<li>Add a dialog that will suggest to reload the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>To preview your intermediate solution hover the mouse pointer over the HTML code to show the browser icons popup, and click the icon that indicates the desired browser. Alternatively, select <strong>View | Open in Browser </strong>from the main menu and then select the desired browser from the list. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>1. The launch button should be locked until all the checkboxes are checked and all the input ranges are set to maximum.</p>

<p>2. When the user presses the launch button, the rocket should start moving.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In a browser, the result of this stage should look something like this:</p>
