summary: 'Have you ever dreamt about exploring deep space? In this project, you''ll
  create a simple web game where you launch a rocket from an uninhabited planet. You
  don''t have to be a rocket scientist to complete this project: we will start from
  the ground up by learning how to implement an HTML skeleton of a page and use CSS.
  Then, we''ll learn how to make the game interactive with JS, and by the end of the
  project, you''ll have a firm knowledge foundation for developing your frontend skills.<br/><br/>Learn
